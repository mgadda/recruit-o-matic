 If you're interested, we're working on a few iOS dev roles that could be a great fit for you. The specific one I wanted to run by you would be with a company called Epic!

Right now Epic has 12 people in their office, and they just received another $8 mil in funding, so they're looking to grow fast.

Let me tell you about a company called DoubleVerify. As the leader in digital performance solutions since 2008, their pioneering technologies have helped hundreds of Fortune 500 companies gain the most value out of their media spend.

What does that mean in English? DV essentially polices and provides quality assurance to advertisers and publishers to get the most effective spend in their campaigns. Must make DV an AdTech company right? Nope. They are a data optimization company and an extremely fast growing tech company. And as the leader in the space, they are looking to double their size in 2016.


So why should you care? Glad you asked. DV is opening a new division called DV Labs and they are looking for employee number one. And if I’ve done my homework right, that should be you. So if you like the idea of being the number one employee in a new division of an industry leader with all the perks that come with that, then let’s set aside a time to discuss this opportunity a little more in detail.

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on my note from last month. I'd love to learn more about you and your goals when it comes to future opportunities.

Please let me know if you're open to chatting!

I run a firm called Fortis Partners. I’m reaching out because I’m working with a radical stealth nutrition startup in Emeryville and thought you might like to hear more.

The company was recently founded by Neil Grimmer (founder of Plum Organics) and has 2+ years of runway with an aim of using heavy science turned into machine-learned algorithms to understand a person’s particular biology and individual response to different food types. Because most diets and nutrition programs nearly always a “one size fits all” method, the company is taking a much more individualized approach by analyzing a person’s health. With this data, the company can offer both an incredibly comprehensive individualized nutrition plan, as well as a daily gourmet food delivery program tailored to maximize a person’s health and overall well-being.

Right now we’re searching for the company’s potential 11th full-time employee - an experienced Ruby on Rails developer who is passionate about clean, beautiful code, experienced with infrastructure and deployment (ideally Circle CI), and interested in joining a small but growing startup-minded engineering team. We can offer a healthy base salary, great benefits, and a very strong early-stage equity package.

Please let me know if you're open to hearing more!

Hope you're having a great Monday! I came across your profile and found your experience with Twitter intriguing.

Here at Medium, we're improving the digital reading/writing landscape through world class typography, platform integration, and new experiences that have yet to be discovered. We've only scratched the surface of what the internet can do to empower more people to share their experiences with the world. If you're open to an exploratory conversation, I'd love to learn about some of the projects you've worked on and what inspires you. Hope to hear from you soon, and happy holidays!

Happy Thursday! You guessed it, its Patrick again with Groupon. I wanted to check in again to tell you that we're working on some killer consumer-focused technical projects that your expertise may be able to have a significant impact on. Besides having an open source culture that thrives on autonomy and encourages ownership, out-of-the-box thinking, and those who (I know I've said this before) like to make a huge impact, the code that Groupon engineers check in today will be running in production that week.  And our engineers are using the best tech -- anyone in the know will tell you that.  (maybe I said that before too, but I wanted to re-iterate it!)

So what else makes Groupon stand out? Here's a little more info about the "big deal" of joining our team:

As I mentioned earlier, I want to make sure you get included on what we have going on.  I'd love to share more info with you. What's the best time for a call?

I wanted to touch base with you given your experience and development work at Twitter.

Uber is an 100% data driven company and is tackling some of the most large-scale, challenging, intensive, and comprehensive data projects in tech. Our team is building the systems that power nearly every key decision at Uber - from pricing to supply positioning to marketplace optimization to accident avoidance to fraud prevention.

We need excellent full stack / back end engineers who can help grow these teams.

I realize you may not be looking to leave at this time, but would you be open to chatting informally?

I just wanted to let you know my colleague, Vikki Pachera, sent you a note on LinkedIn regarding an iOS role we're working on for Vantage Robotics in Burlingame. I know a number of people don't check it often, so just following up. We look forward to hearing from you.

Good afternoon!  Would you be interested in exploring a web front-end engineering opportunity with us at Sean Parker's new startup: Brigade?

How about Tuesday/Wednesday this week? Let me know what works best and I’ll send the invite.

I hope you're having a good Sunday over there.  I thought I'd check in and see if you're still enjoying things Twitter?  I'm hoping you might be open to a chat about working here at UrbandDoor.co in SF.  We're looking for a senior lead engineer to join the 8 person team here in SOMA.  Since we have roles on the front-end, backend, and mobile - we can design a role around what you want to do next.

Arranging, negotiating, tracking global short-term apartments is an absolute nightmare for companies.   Through our exclusive partnership with Greystar - The world's largest owner of residential apartment real estate - UrbanDoor is the first company to offer corporations a portal to the world's largest supply of premium corporate housing with full concierge services and business management tools.  Basically an Airbnb marketplace of corporate apartments.

It's Patrick again with Groupon trying to get in touch with you regarding a fantastic opportunity here. No pressure. I would like to speak confidentially with you, Matt, about what we have available.

I know when companies say things like, "you can really have an impact here," one tends to get skeptical, but at Groupon, it's true.  The code you check in today will be running in production that week.  And our engineers are using the most cutting edge technologies to create big things without much undue oversight -- Ask around and you'll find this to be true.

Would you please either call me tomorrow or send a phone number and best time to call so I may call you? If you would prefer not to be contacted, please let me know.

You intended to respond, and then forgot to follow-up.

You are just too happy, respected and over compensated to consider anything else.

You are slow in taking a hint.

I look forward to talking with you.

I am recruiter here in the Bay Area and simply wanted to introduce myself in case you are looking for new Full Time opportunities in the near future. Your experience based on your LinkedIn account is very impressive but I understand if you are not considering new opportunities at this time. So basically I just wanted to connect with you and hope that you will keep me in mind if you should enter the market next year as I would love to help you with your next career move. Please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn. Otherwise, have a great holiday season!

I came across your profile and I had to reach out as you came across as a strong lead software engineer. I believe you could be great for our team here at Affirm.

We're a fast growing start-up working on a superior product that will change millions of people's lives for the good.  We have a great team of software engineers and our CEO is Max Levchin, cofounder of PayPal.  Our executive team had proven to be very successful with impressive resumes.

We're building a modern bank for the future, committed to providing a more ethical, technologically sophisticated (our proprietary risk model is outperforming the FICO score by 30%!), and efficient alternative to the predatory and corrupt credit industry.

I would love to connect this week and discuss your interests/goals, as well as opportunities available here.

I hope you've been well since my last outreach!

When I initially touched base in October the timing wasn't quite right on your end. Seeing as a few months (and likely quite a few dev cycles) have passed I wanted to reach back out and see if you'd be interested in exploring any of the new consumer-facing products and features we're gearing up to build out in tight-knit, autonomous teams.

Either way, I look forward to hearing from you!

I understand that timing is everything, so I wanted to respectfully follow up from a note I sent last month.

Like I had said, there is no pressure to look outside Twitter if you'd just like to hear more about what we are accomplishing here at Uber. Please let me know a time that might work for you and I can make myself available.

Have a great start to your week!

My records show that two colleagues had tried reaching out to you earlier this year, though to no avail; you're a difficult man to get a hold of : )

With the traffic and scale you've been working with at both Catalpa and now Twitter, coupled with your academic pedigree I thought you might be interested in learning more about what we are accomplishing here at Uber.

There's certainly no obligation to pursue a position outside of Twitter if you'd just like to learn more, so please let me know what time might work best for you and we can find a time to connect.

Either way I look forward to hearing from you Matt; have a great afternoon!

Happy Wednesday!  I hope your week is going great and you're still snacking on Thanksgiving leftovers.  My name is Patrick and I'm with Groupon. I know your time is super valuable, but I would really appreciate a few seconds of it.

Based on research I conducted it appeared you may be knowledgeable in Java and RESTful web services among your other modern skills. Your overall core development and architectural background looked like it really stood out so I was prompted to look you up and indeed found it to be true. I thought you may be someone who might be able to help me if I asked nicely.

I was hoping you might be able to suggest whom I could talk to about back end software engineering positions that we have open. I'm particularly interested in having our recruiters talk to senior SDEs who are passionate and take pride in their work. I recently just started working with this department so my network of senior contacts is pretty small at the moment. As you know, senior individuals prefer to use their professional network to get to senior positions.

My contact info is below; I'd welcome a chance to talk at your convenience and fill you in on any required details. I appreciate you taking the time to read this, Matt, and look forward to your feedback.

Hope you can help at least point me in the right direction?

Thanks in advance!

Hope you are well. I am contacting you on behalf of TinyRx. They just landed a very impressive seed round of $5 million and hiring for their 4th engineer. Your background in Web Development is a really good fit.

TinyRx is aspiring to disrupt a multi-billion dollar industry and reinvent the pharmacy experience. They are backed by top-tier investors.

Please let me know if you're interested in learning more about joining their team?

 head up talent here at Entelo and given you've been at Twitter for nearly 3 years and have used a variety of the same technologies we use (Ruby, Postgres, etc.), I thought there could be a potentially good fit here to help us scale the engineering team to improve what most people would agree is most companies' toughest challenge: recruiting.

Our search product aggregates hundreds of millions of social profiles (we have some very interesting identity resolution challenges around this) and predicts when people are more likely to be looking for a new job. We also launched Entelo Stack, which intelligently sorts inbound job applications to help recruiters quickly and efficiently find their best applicants while providing detailed analytics that talent teams have sorely lacked.

Our stack consists of Ruby, Postgres, Elasticsearch, Go, Docker, Kubernetes (we have one of the larger production clusters) and CoreOS amongst other technologies. We've had tremendous growth ( ~300% revenue growth YoY the past 2 years; have tripled headcount this year), have 300+ amazing customers (Facebook, Tesla, Salesforce, etc.) and believe in being fiscally conservative in order to continue our rapid growth and build a meaningful, enduring company.

If you're open to it, I'd love to connect and explore if there's a strong mutual fit. Free to chat this week?

I’ve reached out to you twice already but I haven’t heard back so I thought I’d try you one last time. I’m really excited to share more information about Snowflake Computing with you!

I emailed you about a week ago about Snowflake Computing. Working at Twitter I'm sure you get millions of these emails from recruiters constantly. We’re very passionate about reinventing datawarehousing using the cloud and I wanted to make sure you had a chance to check us out. Your background in Java based software enigneering is really interesting and relevant to us and it’s a unique opportunity for you to be part of a truly disruptive product team.
