 If you're interested, we're working on a few iOS dev roles that could be a great fit for you. The specific one I wanted to run by you would be with a company called Epic!

If you haven't bought many kids books, they're about $10-$20 a pop, that really adds up after only getting a few.

Right now Epic has 12 people in their office, and they just received another $8 mil in funding, so they're looking to grow fast.

 Even if you aren't looking for a career move, I'd still love to get an idea of where you see your career going. It's nice to have someone in your corner when you do move, whether it's a week or a year down the road.

Let me tell you about a company called DoubleVerify. As the leader in digital performance solutions since 2008, their pioneering technologies have helped hundreds of Fortune 500 companies gain the most value out of their media spend.

What does that mean in English? DV essentially polices and provides quality assurance to advertisers and publishers to get the most effective spend in their campaigns. Must make DV an AdTech company right? Nope. They are a data optimization company and an extremely fast growing tech company. And as the leader in the space, they are looking to double their size in 2016.


So why should you care? Glad you asked. DV is opening a new division called DV Labs and they are looking for employee number one. And if I’ve done my homework right, that should be you. So if you like the idea of being the number one employee in a new division of an industry leader with all the perks that come with that, then let’s set aside a time to discuss this opportunity a little more in detail.

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on my note from last month. I'd love to learn more about you and your goals when it comes to future opportunities.

Please let me know if you're open to chatting!

I run a firm called Fortis Partners. I’m reaching out because I’m working with a radical stealth nutrition startup in Emeryville and thought you might like to hear more.

The company was recently founded by Neil Grimmer (founder of Plum Organics) and has 2+ years of runway with an aim of using heavy science turned into machine-learned algorithms to understand a person’s particular biology and individual response to different food types. Because most diets and nutrition programs nearly always a “one size fits all” method, the company is taking a much more individualized approach by analyzing a person’s health. With this data, the company can offer both an incredibly comprehensive individualized nutrition plan, as well as a daily gourmet food delivery program tailored to maximize a person’s health and overall well-being.

Right now we’re searching for the company’s potential 11th full-time employee - an experienced Ruby on Rails developer who is passionate about clean, beautiful code, experienced with infrastructure and deployment (ideally Circle CI), and interested in joining a small but growing startup-minded engineering team. We can offer a healthy base salary, great benefits, and a very strong early-stage equity package.

Please let me know if you're open to hearing more!

I've reached out to you about opportunities in the past but I recently joined CrunchBase and I'd love to speak with you about joining the team as a Lead Engineer.
